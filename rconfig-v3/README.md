# DEPRECATED

As of February 2023 , this project is no longer maintained. rConfig v3 is fully deprecated and will no longer be supported on the public repository. This notice does not affect customers with current subscription arrangements until the end of the term of those arrangements.

rConfig v3 has been in development since 2010, and I am very proud of its impact and value for network professionals and businesses all over the globe.

Fear not though, we have just released rConfig v6 Core and rConfig v6 Professional has been available for the last year. rConfig v6 is a complete rewrite of the application, and is built on the latest technologies. rConfig v6 Professional is a paid subscription product, and is available for purchase at https://www.rconfig.com. rConfig v6 Core is free and open source, and is available on the rConfig GitHub repository [https://github.com/rconfig/rconfig6-core](https://github.com/rconfig/rconfig6-core).

If you download, and use the code from this repository, you are doing so at your own risk. rConfig v3 is no longer supported, and will not be updated. The code and this repository will remain available for historical purposes only.

# rConfig

rConfig is a free open source network device configuration management utility for network engineers to take frequent configuration snapshots of their network devices. rConfig is unique, because you choose what commands you want to run against your devices. Simply configure rConfig with the list of commands you wish to apply to a category of devices, and add devices to the category. Create a scheduled task, and rConfig will do the rest. rConfig Version 3 now has a Configuration Compliance Management utility to enable you to monitor device configurations for policy compliance.

rConfig is completely open source, meaning, you can customize it, and add features as you please. rConfig is written in native PHP. You will not have to install any extra modules to PHP for rConfig to work.
