2. comment the exit(); statement at the top of your lodelconfig.php file;
3. create a file named from the $cfg['install_key'] variable in the root path;
4. create a database on a mariadb/mysql server somewhere, ie:
	CREATE DATABASE `lodel` CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_general_ci;
	GRANT ALL on `lodel`.* TO `lodeluser`@`127.0.0.1` IDENTIFIED BY "password";	
5. fill at least the DB parameters in your lodelconfig.php file;
6. go to the lodel/scripts directory;
